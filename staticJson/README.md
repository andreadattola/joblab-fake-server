## Static Json

Should there be any problems with the Fake-Server, I have provided static jsons to which api calls can be made (CRUD). 
Just go to the repository in the staticJson folder:
there will be the various files. Get the RAW link and make the call to it. 
For simplicity's sake, here are the links: 
flights : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreadattola/joblab-fake-server/main/staticJson/flights.json
hotels: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreadattola/joblab-fake-server/main/staticJson/hotels.json
places: https://github.com/andreadattola/joblab-fake-server/blob/main/staticJson/places.json
restaurants: https://github.com/andreadattola/joblab-fake-server/blob/main/staticJson/restaurants.json
